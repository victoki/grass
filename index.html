						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<!-- I should probably not be using div/span. Couldn't find a good replacement for inline spans below. I'll likely learn what I can do instead of
						div/span tags in this class. 
						
						I'm reusing some css from prior class I made for a project because it uses flexbox and looks really pleasing.
						Exercise was to make site for a landscaping company and I played with it a while to get something nice. -->
						
						<article class="about">
							<p>My name is Victoria. I am a Canadian living in the USA. I worked as a game artist for a decade and have since decided to
							change careers. I spend my free time outside work and school playing video games and taking care of a few pet reptiles. 
							I'm currently studying java in my free time, and think its a neat language with some weird quirks. For example, all the
							data types for java are lowercase. Except this guy: String. If you try to declare 'string' it freaks the compiler out, because 'String' is special and absolutely needs to be upper case.</p>
						
							<p>Things I would like to learn:</p>

							<strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Cleaner Code</li>
								<li>Making CSS do crazier wizard-things with your webpages</li>
								<li>More ways to use html5/css/javascript</li>
								<li>More applications that use all three of the above.</li>
								<li>How to get my job to give me more time so I don't recycle my old CSS.</li>
							</ul>
